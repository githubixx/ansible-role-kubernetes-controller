# ansible-role-kubernetes-controller

This role is used in [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible - Control plane](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-control-plane/). It installs the Kubernetes API server, scheduler and controller manager. For more information about this role please have a look at [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible - Control plane](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-control-plane/).

## Versions

I tag every release and try to stay with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). If you want to use the role I recommend to checkout the latest tag. The master branch is basically development while the tags mark stable releases. But in general I try to keep master in good shape too. A tag `23.0.0+1.28.5` means this is release `23.0.0` of this role and it's meant to be used with Kubernetes version `1.28.5` (but should work with any K8s 1.27.x release of course). If the role itself changes `X.Y.Z` before `+` will increase. If the Kubernetes version changes `X.Y.Z` after `+` will increase too. This allows to tag bugfixes and new major versions of the role while it's still developed for a specific Kubernetes release. That's especially useful for Kubernetes major releases with breaking changes.

## Requirements

This role requires that you already created some certificates for Kubernetes API server (see [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible - Certificate authority (CA)](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-certificate-authority/)). The role copies the certificates from `k8s_ctl_ca_conf_directory` (which is by default the same as `k8s_ca_conf_directory` used by `githubixx.kubernetes_ca` role) to the destination host. You should also setup a fully meshed VPN with e.g. WireGuard (see [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible - WireGuard](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-wireguard/)) and of course an etcd cluster (see [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible - etcd cluster](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-etcd/)). The WireGuard VPN Mesh is not a requirement but increases security as all traffic between the K8s hosts is encrypted by default. But as long as all hosts included have an interface where they can communicate with each other it's fine.

**Recent changes:**

## 23.1.1+1.28.5

### BUGFIX

- ClusterRoleBinding `system:kube-apiserver` needs to honor `k8s_apiserver_csr_cn` value for as username
- Because of the previous change move `files/kube-apiserver-to-kubelet_cluster_role.yaml -> templates/rbac/kube-apiserver-to-kubelet_cluster_role.yaml.j2` and `files/kube-apiserver-to-kubelet_cluster_role_binding.yaml -> templates/rbac/kube-apiserver-to-kubelet_cluster_role_binding.yaml.j2` as both files became a Jinja2 template.

## 23.1.0+1.28.5

### MOLECULE

- Change to Ubuntu 22.04 for test-assets VM
- Adjust common names for certificates / change algo to ecdsa and algo size

### OTHER CHANGES

- fix permissions for temporary directory
- adjust Github action because of Ansible Galaxy changes

## 23.0.0+1.28.5

### GENERAL

If you upgrade from a release < `22.0.0+1.27.8` please read the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-kubernetes-controller/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) carefully! Version `22.0.0+1.27.8` had quite a few breaking changes!

### UPDATE

- update `k8s_release` to `1.28.5`

### BREAKING

- Extend `enable-admission-plugins` in `k8s_apiserver_settings` by: `PodSecurity,Priority,StorageObjectInUseProtection,RuntimeClass,CertificateApproval,CertificateSigning,ClusterTrustBundleAttest,CertificateSubjectRestriction,DefaultIngressClass`. These are enabled by default if this flag is not specified (see [Admission Controllers Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) for more information).

### MOLECULE

- Change IP addresses

## 22.0.0+1.27.8

### PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

This release contains quite a few potential breaking changes! So review carefully before rolling out the new version of this role! A bigger part of the whole changes are related to increase security. While most of the new variables
 and defaults should be just fine and should just work out of the box side effects might occur.

All the newly introduced or changed variables have detailed comments in [README](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-kubernetes-controller/blob/master/README.md). So please read them carefully!

This refactoring was needed to make it possible to have `githubixx.kubernetes_controller` and `githubixx.kubernetes_worker` deployed on the same host e.g. They were some intersections between the two roles that had to be fixed.

**Please remove** `/var/lib/kubernetes/admin.kubeconfig` on the K8s controller nodes (if you didn't change the default directory for this file). Older versions of this role created this file. It's no longer needed. It contains the
`kubeconfig` (so basically the credentials file) for the `admin` user. This is a very powerful user (actually the user with the most permissions). So use with care and store the file in a secure place! `admin.kubeconfig` should onl
y be used at the very beginning to create a new user with less permissions.

### UPDATE

- update `k8s_release` to `1.27.8`

### BREAKING

- Rename variable `k8s_conf_dir` to `k8s_ctl_conf_dir`. Additionally the default value changed from `/usr/lib/kubernetes` to `/etc/kubernetes/controller`.
- Introduce variable `k8s_admin_conf_dir`. Currently it only stores `admin.kubeconfig` which is basically the credentials file of the `admin` "user". Formerly this file was stored in the directory specified in the (now removed) `k8
s_config_directory` variable. The default value of `k8s_admin_conf_dir` is the same as the removed `k8s_config_directory`. Additionally to set permissions for `k8s_admin_conf_dir` the following variables were introduced: `k8s_admin
_conf_dir_perm`, `k8s_admin_conf_owner` and `k8s_admin_conf_group`.
- Introduce variable `k8s_ctl_pki_dir`. All certificate files specified in `k8s_ctl_certificates` and `k8s_ctl_etcd_certificates` (see `vars/main.yml`) will be stored here. Related to this: Certificate related settings in `k8s_apiserver_settings` used `k8s_conf_dir` before and now use `k8s_ctl_pki_dir`. That's `client-ca-file`, `etcd-cafile`, `etcd-certfile`, `etcd-keyfile`, `kubelet-certificate-authority`, `kubelet-client-certificate`, `kubelet-client-key`,
 `service-account-key-file`, `service-account-signing-key-file`, `tls-cert-file` and `tls-private-key-file`. For `k8s_controller_manager_settings` that's: `cluster-signing-cert-file`, `cluster-signing-key-file`, `root-ca-file`, `re
questheader-client-ca-file` and `service-account-private-key-file`. And for `k8s_scheduler_settings` that's: `requestheader-client-ca-file`.
- Rename variable `k8s_bin_dir` to `k8s_ctl_bin_dir`.
- Rename variable `k8s_release` to `k8s_ctl_release`.
- The default value for `k8s_interface` changed from `tap0` to `eth0`.
- Rename variable `k8s_controller_binaries` to `k8s_ctl_binaries`. Additionally this variable is no longer defined in `defaults/main.yml` but in `vars/main.yml`. Since this list is fixed anyways it makes no sense to allow to modify
 this list.
- Rename variable `k8s_certificates` to `k8s_ctl_certificates`.
- Rename variable `etcd_certificates` to `k8s_ctl_etcd_certificates`. Additionally this variable is no longer defined in `defaults/main.yml` but in `vars/main.yml`. Since this list is fixed anyways it makes no sense to allow to mod
ify this list.
- Rename variable `etcd_client_port` to `k8s_ctl_etcd_client_port`.
- Rename variable `etcd_interface` to `k8s_ctl_etcd_interface`. Additionally the default value changed from `tap0` to `eth0`.
- Use `k8s_ctl_etcd_interface` variable instead of `k8s_interface` for `--etcd-servers` option in `templates/etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service.j2`. Normally `etcd` and `kube-apiserver` listen on the same interface. But if someone specified `k8s_ctl_etcd_interface` (formerly `etcd_interface` in the context of this role) it was basically ignored as the value of `k8s_interface` was used instead. That's fixed now.
- Rename variable `k8s_controller_delegate_to` to `k8s_ctl_delegate_to`.
- Introduce `k8s_apiserver_conf_dir` variable. `encryption-config.yaml` is now located in `k8s_apiserver_conf_dir`.
- Change default value of `k8s_controller_manager_conf_dir` to `"{{ k8s_ctl_conf_dir }}/kube-controller-manager"`.
- Change default value of `k8s_scheduler_conf_dir` to `"{{ k8s_ctl_conf_dir }}/kube-scheduler"`.
- Rename `kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig` to `kubeconfig`. This affects `k8s_controller_manager_settings` and the following settings: `authentication-kubeconfig`, `authorization-kubeconfig` and `kubeconfig`.
- Rename `kube-scheduler.kubeconfig` to `kubeconfig`. This affects `k8s_scheduler_settings` and the following settings: `authentication-kubeconfig"` and `authorization-kubeconfig`.
- Added new option `encryption-provider-config-automatic-reload: "true"` to `k8s_apiserver_settings`. In case the file specified in `encryption-provider-config` changes `kube-apiserver` will automatically reload that file. This is
handy if one wants to change the encryption provider (also see new variable `k8s_apiserver_encryption_provider_config`)
- Introduce `k8s_ctl_service_options` variable. As mentioned above already previously `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` were running as user `root`. Now these services will run as `k8s_run_as_user` an
d `k8s_run_as_group`. Additionally `systemd` allows to limit the exposure of the system towards the unit's processes. Basically all settings below `RestartSec=5` are related to increase security and limit what the process allowed t
o do. So these settings reduce the attack surface quite a bit already. They're not perfect but a starting point. If you want the previous behavior just remove all settings besides `Restart` and `RestartSec`. But that also means tha
t they'll run again as `root` user.
- The following variables are no longer used and can be removed: `k8s_encryption_config_directory`, `k8s_encryption_config_owner`, `k8s_encryption_config_group`, `k8s_encryption_config_directory_perm` and `k8s_encryption_config_fil
e_perm`. Previously these values were needed to specify permissions on the Ansible controller for this file/directory. Since this file is now generated directly on the K8s controller nodes they're no longer needed. That also means
you can remove `encryption-config.yaml` from Ansible controller node (like your workstation e.g.)
- The variable `k8s_config_directory` is gone. It's no longer in use. After the upgrade to this release you can delete this directory (if you accept the new default!) and it's content (make a backup esp. of `admin.kubeconfig` file
- just in case!)
- Rename `k8s_ca_conf_directory` to `k8s_ctl_ca_conf_directory`

### FEATURE

- Introduce `k8s_run_as_user` variable. Previously all control plane services like `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager` run as user `root`. Securitywise that's not optimal. There is just no need to run t
hem as `root` as long they use a listening port > `1024` which they do by default. In this version all these services will run as the user specified with `k8s_run_as_user` which is `k8s` by default. Related to this variable are the
 new variables `k8s_run_as_user_shell`, `k8s_run_as_user_system`, `k8s_run_as_group` and `k8s_run_as_group_system`. See [README](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-kubernetes-controller/blob/master/README.md) for further information about this variables. The defaults should be just fine even for upgrading from a previous version of this role.
- Introduce `k8s_ctl_api_endpoint_host` and `k8s_ctl_api_endpoint_port` variables. Previously `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager` where configured to connect to the first host in the Ansible `k8s_controller` group and communicate with the `kube-apiserver` that was running there. This was hard-coded and couldn't be changed. If that host was down the K8s worker nodes didn't receive any updates. Now one can install and use a load balancer like `haproxy` e.g. that distributes requests between all `kube-apiserver`'s and takes a `kube-apiserver` out of rotation if that one is down (also see my Ansible [haproxy role](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-haproxy) for that use
case). The default is still to use the first host/kube-apiserver in the Ansible `k8s_controller` group. So behaviorwise nothing changed basically.
- Introduce `k8s_admin_api_endpoint_host` and `k8s_admin_api_endpoint_port` variables. For these two variables the same is basically true as for `k8s_ctl_api_endpoint_host` and `k8s_ctl_api_endpoint_port` variables above. But these
 settings are meant to be used by the `admin` user that this role creates by default. These settings are written into `admin.kubeconfig`. So it's possible to configure another host/load balancer for the `admin` user as for the K8s
control plane services mentioned in the previous paragraph.
- Introduce `k8s_ctl_log_base_dir` and `k8s_ctl_log_base_dir_mode`. Normally  `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` log to `journald`. But there are exceptions like the audit log. For this kind of log fil
es this directory will be used as a base path.
- Introduce `k8s_apiserver_audit_log_dir`. Directory to store kube-apiserver audit logs.
- Introduce `k8s_apiserver_encryption_provider_config` variable. Previously the content of this file was hard-coded. Now it's exposed via this variable. The content of that variable and the previously hard-coded value are the same.
 So if you keep the default when upgrading everything stays the same in that regards. **NOTE**: Changing this configuration and deploy the changes can potentially cause quite some problems! Make sure to read [Encrypting Confidential Data at Rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) and esp. [Rotating a decryption key](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#rotating-a-decryption-key)!
- Add task to generate `kubeconfig` for `admin` user (previously this was a separate [playbook](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-kubernetes-playbooks/tree/v15.0.0_r1.27.5/kubeauthconfig)).
- Add task to generate `kubeconfig` for `kube-controller-manager` service (previously this was a separate [playbook](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-kubernetes-playbooks/tree/v15.0.0_r1.27.5/kubeauthconfig)).
- Add task to generate `kubeconfig` for `kube-scheduler` service (previously this was a separate [playbook](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-kubernetes-playbooks/tree/v15.0.0_r1.27.5/kubeauthconfig)).
- When downloading the Kubernetes binaries the task checks the SHA512 checksum
- Make `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager` wait until `kube-apiserver` has started and is listening on a port

### OTHER CHANGES

- Extend `k8s_ctl_certificates` (formerly `k8s_certificates`) list by `cert-k8s-scheduler` and `cert-k8s-controller-manager` files. This was needed as the `kubeconfig` files are now generated on the K8s controller nodes and no long
er on the Ansible controller host. Previously it was needed to prepare these files upfront before installing this role. That's no longer needed. Also see **FEATURES** list above.
- Use `kubernetes.core.*` modules instead of `kubectl` binary
- Fix some `ansible-lint` issues

### MOLECULE

- Updated all files to reflect the changes introduces with this version
- Tasks for creating `kubeconfig` for `kube-controller-manager`, `kube-scheduler`, `admin` user and `encryption configuration` are no longer needed as they're now part of `kubernetes_controller` role
- Add `haproxy` to Ubuntu 22 hosts to test new `k8s_ctl_api_endpoint_host` and `k8s_ctl_api_endpoint_port` settings
- Add tasks to install [ansible-role-cni](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-cni) and [ansible-role-runc](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-runc)
- Use `kubernetes.core.k8s_info` module instead of calling `kubectl` binary

## Installation

- Directly download from Github (Change into Ansible roles directory before cloning. You can figure out the role path by using `ansible-config dump | grep DEFAULT_ROLES_PATH` command):
`git clone https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-kubernetes-controller.git githubixx.kubernetes_controller`

- Via `ansible-galaxy` command and download directly from Ansible Galaxy:
`ansible-galaxy install role githubixx.kubernetes_controller`

- Create a `requirements.yml` file with the following content (this will download the role from Github) and install with
`ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml` (change `version` if needed):

```yaml

# All certificate files (Private Key Infrastructure related) specified in
# "k8s_ctl_certificates" and "k8s_ctl_etcd_certificates" (see "vars/main.yml")
# will be stored here. Owner of this new directory will be "root". Group will
# be the group specified in "k8s_run_as_group"`. The files in this directory

# This is the content of "encryption-config.yaml". Used by "kube-apiserver"
# (see "encryption-provider-config" option in "k8s_apiserver_settings").
# "kube-apiserver" will use this configuration to encrypt data before storing
# it in etcd (encrypt data at-rest).
#
# The configuration below is a usable example but might not fit your needs.
# So please review carefully! E.g. you might want to replace "aescbc" provider
# with a different one like "secretbox". As you can see this configuration only
# encrypts "secrets" at-rest. But it's also possible to encrypt other K8s
# resources. NOTE: "identity" provider doesn't encrypt anything! That means
# plain text. In the configuration below it's used as fallback.
#
# If you keep the default defined below please make sure to specify the
# variable "k8s_encryption_config_key" somewhere (e.g. "group_vars/all.yml" or
# even better use "ansible-vault" to store these kind of secrets).
# This needs to be a base64 encoded value. To create such a value on Linux
# run the following command:
#
# head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
#
# For a detailed description please visit:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/
#
# How to rotate the encryption key or to implement encryption at-rest in
# an existing K8s cluster please visit:

The kube-apiserver settings defined in `k8s_apiserver_settings` can be overridden by defining a variable called `k8s_apiserver_settings_user`. You can also add additional settings by using this variable. E.g. to override `audit-log-maxage` and `audit-log-maxbackup` default values and add `watch-cache` add the following settings to `group_vars/k8s.yml`:

```yaml
k8s_apiserver_settings_user:
  "audit-log-maxage": "40"
  "audit-log-maxbackup": "4"
  "watch-cache": "false"
```

The same is true for the `kube-controller-manager` by adding entries to `k8s_controller_manager_settings_user` variable. For `kube-scheduler` add entries to `k8s_scheduler_settings_user` variable to override/add settings in `k8s_scheduler_settings` dictionary.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: k8s_controller
  roles:
    - githubixx.kubernetes_controller
```

## Testing

This role has a small test setup that is created using [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule), libvirt (vagrant-libvirt) and QEMU/KVM. Please see my blog post [Testing Ansible roles with Molecule, libvirt (vagrant-libvirt) and QEMU/KVM](https://www.tauceti.blog/posts/testing-ansible-roles-with-molecule-libvirt-vagrant-qemu-kvm/) how to setup. The test configuration is [here](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-kubernetes-controller/tree/master/molecule/default).

Afterwards Molecule can be executed:

```bash
molecule converge
```

This will setup a few virtual machines (VM) with supported Ubuntu OS and installs an Kubernetes cluster but without the worker nodes (so no nodes with `kube-proxy` and `kubelet` installed). A small verification step is also included:

```bash
molecule verify
```

To clean up run

```bash
molecule destroy
```
